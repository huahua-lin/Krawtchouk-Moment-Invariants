This is the MATLAB package for implementing 3D Krawtchouk moments.

It can extract both local and global features from 3D images.

The features derived from the 3D images remain stable under translation, scaling, and rotation.

The program’s dependencies include the “Symbolic Math Toolbox” and the “Image Processing Toolbox”.

A quick-start guide and examples are available at https://krawtchouk.github.io/.
